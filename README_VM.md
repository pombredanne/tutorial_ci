Setting up the Continuous Integration Server
============================================

In order to work with the tutorial in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Test Automation" book you need a Jenkins continuous integration server. You will also need runtime environments for the test suites. 

I am evangelizing the use of Linux operating systems for test automation. If you do not have a linux system available you can download a virtual machine that includes everything that is necessary. This document describes where to download the VM and where to find more information on the process.
